        <h3>Professional Background</h3>
        <p>I am a systems engineer and I have worked many years in sofwtare development on mainframe platforms.
          I also worked full-time as a General Manager in my home, mothering four amazing kids who are now living their own lives very happily.
          So I decided it was time to get back at full speed on coding, which is what I love to do üë©‚Äçüíª.

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I love sports! I workout at the gym, I do biking, running and also swimming. I love to go to the movies.
          I am also passionate about music. I play the drums (samba style) and a little bit of guitar and piano. Oh, I almost forgot, I also love to do yoga and meditation!üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
